* Build dist, run tests and create eclipse classpath

The easiest approach is to look in the files for a similar module and just copy/paste/modify.

/build.xml                   Builds dist and examples and runs unit tests.
/build/build.xml             Deploys jars to local maven repo
/build/classpath.tmpl        Classpath entries used when running ant eclipseclasspath
/build/ci.build.xml          Publishes seam to snapshot repo (?)
/build/root.pom.xml          Contains all maven dependencies. Versions go here.
/build/yourMod.pom.xml       Pom for the module with appropriate dependencies. All deps must be in 
                             http://repository.jboss.com/maven2/


* Build examples
/examples/build.xml          "Mother" ant script for the examples. Most(all?) buils example scripts 
                             import this script. 
/examples/yourMod/build.xml  Essentially just sets some properties. Then the mother script does it all



* Add docs
Put your doc in /doc/Seam_Reference_Guide/en-US (or appropriate language) and add it to
/doc/Seam_Reference_Guide/en-US/master.xml
